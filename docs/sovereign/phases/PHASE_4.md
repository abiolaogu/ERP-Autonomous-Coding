# ERP-Autonomous-Coding - Phase 4: Reliability, Security, and Compliance

Last updated: 2026-02-28

## Objectives

- Category: **Autonomous Software Delivery**
- North-star: Enable policy-constrained autonomous engineering with measurable delivery acceleration.
- Benchmarks: GitHub Copilot Workspace, Sourcegraph Cody, Cursor

## Expected Outcomes

- SLO controls satisfy availability 99.9% and p95 <= 300ms.
- Security and policy checks fail closed for prohibited operations.
- Runbooks and alerting are mapped to service ownership.

## Implementation Steps

- Deploy `infra/sovereign/ops/slo-alert-rules.yaml` and release checklist.
- Enable guardrail middleware/package in mutation-capable services.
- Validate evidence for tenant isolation and least-privilege access.

## AIDD Guardrail Alignment

- Autonomous: low-risk, high-confidence operations only.
- Supervised: approvals required for high-value or broad-impact operations.
- Protected: cross-tenant, privilege-escalation, and destructive unsafe actions are blocked.

## Domain Event Focus

- Contract and test flow for `coding.plans`
- Contract and test flow for `coding.runs`
- Contract and test flow for `coding.reviews`
